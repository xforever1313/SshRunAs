The MSI bundled with this package is the same MSI that is posted to the file server at https://files.shendrick.net/projects/sshrunas/releases/.

The directory that contains the release on the file server contains a .sha256 file.  For example, for version 2.0.0, the MSI
will be located at https://files.shendrick.net/projects/sshrunas/releases/2.0.0/SshRunAs.msi, while the .sha256 is a text file located at
https://files.shendrick.net/projects/sshrunas/releases/2.0.0/SshRunAs.msi.sha256

The value in the sha256 file will match the value in ChocolateyInstall.ps1.

One can also download the .msi from the file server, get the sha256 sum of it.  It will match the value in ChocolateyInstall.ps1.
